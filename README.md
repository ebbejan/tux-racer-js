TuxRacer.JS is a port and rewrite of *Extreme Tux Racer*, which itself is based on the original *Tux Racer* game. This project allows you to enjoy Tux Racer directly in your web browser, supporting all major desktop and mobile browsers.

**Note:** This project is in an early development stage and far from complete. However, some courses are already functional enough to provide a fun experience (at least for me!).

## How to Play

### Controls
- **Desktop:** Use either the keyboard (WASD or arrow keys) or the mouse to control Tux.
- **Mobile:** Control Tux using touch input via a virtual joystick.

### Tips
- **Paddling forward** helps Tux gain initial speed but is unnecessary once he reaches high velocity.
- **Braking** is useful for mastering tight turns.
- **Terrain type** significantly impacts Tux's acceleration and handling.
